# E-Sky - Paysky Task

A mobile application developed as part of a Paysky task, showcasing product management, browsing, and payment workflow.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React Native
- Backend: Node.js & Express
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Payment Integration: Stripe (with Mock Payment mode for development/demo)

## Features

- Browse and view a list of products fetched from MongoDB Atlas
- Mock payment workflow to simulate transactions during development By **Stripe**
